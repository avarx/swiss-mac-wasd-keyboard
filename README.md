# swiss-mac-wasd-keyboard
**Swiss** Mac layout file for WASD keyboard
based on [CustomMacKeycaps](https://github.com/ychw/CustomMacKeycaps)

This is a [WASD keyboard](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/) template with the **Swiss Apple** keyboard layout.

# How To
1. Download the .ai file from this repository.
2. Feel free to modify it to fit your needs.
3. Go to [this page](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/mechanical-keyboard/wasd-v2-87-key-custom-mechanical-keyboard.html) and upload your .ai file.
4. Map the keys to the labeled functions. I use [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) to do that.
5. Copy [private.xml](https://github.com/avarx/swiss-mac-wasd-keyboard/blob/master/private.xml) to /Users/YOURUSERNAME/Library/Application Support/Karabiner
6. Run [karabiner-import.sh](https://github.com/avarx/swiss-mac-wasd-keyboard/blob/master/private.xml) to select the mappings.
